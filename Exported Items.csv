The primary airr. was to assess whether it would be possible to achieve operant conditioning of the heart rate, evoked not as a secondary reflex response of any voluntary skeletal muscular contrac· tions of trunk but as a conditioned voluntary function of the central autonomic regulation of a visceral organ, since this entire subject was peculiarly left in confusion by Miller (5,8) who wanted that others should independently study it. This study revealed interestingly that not every subject might be able to achieve the visceral learning in a given set of conditions, and suggested that this type of a special learning might be dependent on individual predisposition in the central nervous system. In the present study, 15 showed the learning, out of the 58 subjects assessed. It was also observed that there was a variation in the magnitude of the learning response among different learners, and, also, in the same subject in different sessions conducted on different days. This is considered as an indication that this type of conditioned autonomic function is probably not easily recruited into the long-term memory mechanisms. The overall average of the operant lowering of the heart rate progressively achieved by the end part of the learning session was about 10.5% from the basal average rate, and the score of reinforcement (per cent of painful tail shocks avoided, or of increase in number of brain shocks achieved) was over 80%. The extinction test confirmed the learning. Control experiments revealed that the conditioned heart rate changes were not due to any unconditioned stimulus effects. The learning observed under the brain-stimulation reinforcement was confirmed by losing the learning response after lesioning the site of the rewarding stimulation. The visceral operant learning occurring in state of somatomotor paralysis under both negative and positive types of reinforcement was blocked by haloperidol. Morphine delayed the onset of the pain avoidance operant learning, whereas it speeded up the hedonic brainstimulation operant learning. The results, considered from all the above angles, dispell the doubt previously expressed about the occurrence of the operant conditioning of heart rate under a visceral learning paradigm.","1988-05","2025-05-06 05:36:41","2025-05-06 06:43:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\NT82UUCG\Bindu and Desiraju - 1988 - Indian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology - Success of autonomic operant conditioning of heart rate without involving contractions of somatic sk.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The anatomical regions affected in PSP and those regulating sleep and wake cycle like dorsal raphe nucleus, locus coeruleus (LC), and pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) overlap. There is a paucity of polysomnographic studies in PSP and they have shown altered sleep architecture.           Objective:            To study the sleep architecture in patients with PSP using video-polysomnography (vPSG) and correlate it with the disease severity and duration.           Methods:            This was a prospective, cross-sectional, case-control, single-center study. A total of 22 patients with PSP and 15 age and gender-matched controls were recruited. The cases and controls underwent clinical assessment, face-to-face interviews with sleep questionnaires, anxiety and depression scales, and one overnight vPSG. The sleep architecture was analyzed in detail.           Results:            The sleep architecture was altered as compared to the controls. The total sleep time, stage N2 duration, stage N3 duration, rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep duration, sleep efficiency %, and N2%, N3%, and REM% were significantly lesser in PSP patients. The wake duration, wake after sleep onset (WASO) duration, wake%, WASO%, stage N1 duration was significantly greater in PSP patients. The stage N2 and N3 latencies were significantly prolonged in patients. REM sleep without atonia was noted in four patients and no patients had vPSG proven REM sleep behavior disorder.           Conclusions:            Sleep architecture is altered in PSP even during the early stages of the disease. There is reduced total sleep including both non-REM and REM sleep, sleep efficiency, prolonged sleep latencies, and increased wake duration. This correlates with the neurodegenerative processes affecting the anatomical region regulating the sleep/wake cycle like dorsal raphe nucleus, locus coeruleus (LC), pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN).","2022","2025-05-06 05:36:24","2025-05-14 08:44:32","2025-05-05 10:03:11","","","","","","","Sleep Architecture in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","journals.lww.com","","","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\H27LM9WX\Boini et al. - 2022 - Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology - Sleep Architecture in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy A...

Before making the lesions, the SS rate of each electrode site and the feeding behaviour were characterised for each rat, and rats without robust SS rates were excluded. After making medium size lesions through the electrodes bilaterally in one of the two regions, SS was lost from only those electrode sites but not from the electrodes present in the other region. Even after all the four sites were lesioned (medium size) and the SS of the four sites was abolished, the levels of dopamine (DA) noradrenaline (NA) and serotonin (5-HT) were only marginally (15 to 20%) decreased and statistical significance reached in only hypothalamus but not so consistently in the other regions of the brain examined (motor cortex, hippocampus, striatum, ventral brainstem). This indicated clearly that the robust SS rates at the loci of electrode tips could not be substantially due to involvement of the above categories of monoaminergic neurons and related synapses, but that non-monoaminergic pathways present at the loci could have formed the main basis for the SS of the loci. In contrast to the loss of SS at the 4 lesioned sites, and the 20% reduction of the amines, the feeding behaviour in both operant and free- field condition was not significantly affected in those subjects. Contrary to above, larger size lesions made in both regions have affected markedly both SS and feeding behaviours. However, even with such lesions, the reduction in the levels of the three amines was usually less than 40% in different brain regions. Hence the marked reduction in feeding behaviour and SS behaviour in these subjects may not be mainly due to the impairment of the monoaminergic systems as their levels are still high (over 60%). Large lesions made bilaterally through only LH have lead to a significant reduction in only feeding behaviour, but not in the SS of the intact electrodes located in SN-VTA. The amine levels fell by 30% in only hypothalamus and none in other regions. In contrast to this, such large lesions made bilaterally through SN-VTA have affected the two operant behaviours (SS of the intact LH electrode sites, and the FR-5 for food reward), but not the free-field food intake These lesions caused a significant reduction of NA and 5-HT in brainstem and DA and 5-HT in striatum. NA and 5-HT was significantly reduced in motor cortex also. However, these reductions also were only 20-25%. Hence, once again, these observations also with large lesions of SS areas indicated a poor correlation of involvement of catecholaminergic pathways in LH and SN-VTA in their SS (and feeding) behaviours. On the whole, the results do not provide interpretations to support catecholamine theories of rewarding behaviours, and they draw major attention towards the role of non-monoaminergic neural systems.","1992-01-01","2025-05-06 05:36:42","2025-05-09 11:21:54","","207-219","","","8","","Biogenic Amines","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\MNXZJXZP\Bindu and Desiraju - 1992 - Biogenic Amines - Loss of self-stimulation in lateral hypothalamus and substantia nigra - ventral tegmental area cause.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mesenchymal stem cell therapy has gained colossal attention as a therapeutic alternative in treating neurodegenerative diseases (ND). The challenges in cell-based therapy comprises of defining a suitable cell type expressing homing factors, the precise injection/administration timing based on blood brain barrier (BBB) dynamics and the route of administration that would aid in functional recovery. Even though, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) were extensively investigated for their role in treating spectrum of diseases, the limitations like painful bone marrow extraction, modest yield and poor CNS engraftment following systemic injections prompt to search for an alternate source of MSCs. We hypothesize that neural crest derived dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) would be a better candidate for treating ND due to its ease isolation, higher yield and for their inherent propensity towards neural lineage. We investigated the migratory potential of DPSC vs BM-MSC in in- vitro and in vivo models of kainic acid (KA) induced neurodegeneration. Methods. Trans-well, matrigel, and chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) migration assays were carried out in an in vitro model of neurodegeneration. We assessed the CNS engraftment potential of DPSC/BM-MSC following intravenous administration in animal model of KA mediated hippocampal neurodegeneration and also studied the role of BBB damage after excitotoxicity to facilitate efficient homing of DPSC/BM-MSC. Functional recovery was assessed by a battery of behavioural tests after stem cell injection. Results. Following KA treatment to neurons in vitro, the migration potential of DPSC towards the degenerating site was significantly higher than BM-MSC. To validate the in vitro observations, KA administration resulted in BBB damage and intravenous administration of DPSC in synchronization with KA mediated BBB damage resulted in prominent CNS engraftment and behavioral recovery compared to BM-MSC. Conclusion. Neural crest originated DPSC might possess better CNS engraftment following systemic injection.","2021-08-01","2025-05-06 05:36:36","2025-05-14 08:58:48","2025-05-05 10:11:16","e82-e83","","8","132","","Clinical Neurophysiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","Number: 8","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\V9KJIZV2\Senthilkumar et al. - 2021 - Clinical Neurophysiology - P-EP013.

Studies on autopsied substantia nigra (SN) of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients and experimental models propose gliosis as a trigger for neuronal loss. Epidemiological studies propose an ethnic bias in PD prevalence, since Caucasians are more susceptible than non-whites. Similarly, different mice strains are variably sensitive to MPTP. We had earlier likened divergent MPTP sensitivity of C57BL/6 J and CD-1 mice with differential susceptibility to PD, based on the numbers of SN neurons. We examined whether the variability was incumbent to inter-strain differences in glial features of male C57BL/6 J and CD-1 mice. Stereological counts showed relatively more microglia and fewer astrocytes in the SN of normal C57BL/6 J mice, suggesting persistence of an immune-vigilant state. MPTP-induced microgliosis and astrogliosis in both strains suggest their involvement in pathogenesis. ELISA of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the ventral-midbrain revealed augmentation of TNF-α and IL-6 at middle age in both strains that reduced at old age, suggesting middle age as a critical, inflamm-aging-associated time point. TNF-α levels were high in C57BL/6 J, through aging and post-MPTP, while IL-6 and IL-1β were upregulated at old age. CD-1 had higher levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-β. MPTP challenge caused upregulation of enzymes MAO-A, MAO-B, and iNOS in both strains. Post-MPTP enhancement in fractalkine and hemeoxygenase-1 may be neuron-associated compensatory signals. Ultrastructural observations of elongated astroglial/microglial mitochondria vis-à-vis the shrunken ones in neurons suggest a scale-up of their functions with neurotoxic consequences. Thus, astroglia and microglia may modulate aging and PD susceptibility.","2025-01-20","2025-05-06 05:36:32","2025-05-06 05:36:32","2025-05-05 10:10:50","13","","1","45","","Cell Mol Neurobiol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","Number: 1","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\NTIGVQKC\Abhilash et al. - 2025 - Aging and MPTP Sensitivity Depend on Molecular and Ultrastructural Signatures of Astroglia and Micro.pdf","","","1-Methyl-4-Phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-Tetrahydropyridine (MPTP); CD-1 white mice; Cytokine ELISA; Monoamine oxidases a&b; Neuroinflammation; Parkinson’s disease; Substantia nigra pars compacta; Unbiased stereology, C57BL/6 J","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment is challenging and routinely missed in clinical practice. Our study aimed to study the efficacy of NIMHANS Neuropsychological Battery for Elderly (NNB-E) in diagnosing subtle cognitive deficits in PD patients.           Objective:            The aim of this study is to validate NNB-E and evaluate cognitive impairment in PD patients in comparison with healthy controls.           Methods:            We recruited 31 PD patients and 31 healthy controls in the current study. We validated NNB-E using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, Crohnbach’s alpha, principal component analysis, and Pearson product-moment correlation, and studied the cognitive impairments using NNB-E in the non-demented PD patients and controls who scored ≥24 on HMSE.           Results:            Cognitive performance of PD patients was poor compared to controls. NNB-E showed good internal consistency and construct validity with Crohnbach’s alpha of 0.861 and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.878. The battery was able to detect mild cognitive impairment in 74.1% of patients and 6.4% of controls. The ROC curve showed that the overall sensitivity of the battery was 73.2% and specificity was 92.6% at an optimal cutoff score. Different cutoff values set for defining PD-MCI as per MDS task force criteria resulted in varying frequencies of MCI ranging from 25.8% to 71%.           Conclusion:            Our study established the validity of NNB-E in PD patients, and this tool was suitable for diagnosing PD-MCI and discriminating PD patients from normal controls in the Indian population. This study also showed PD-MCI at various cutoff scores with greater impairment in executive and attention domains.","2023-05","2025-05-06 05:36:31","2025-05-14 08:57:26","2025-05-05 10:09:04","247","","3","26","","","NIMHANS Neuropsychological Battery for Elderly in Parkinson’s Disease Patients","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","journals.lww.com","","Number: 3","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\S4RCSQ7H\Botta et al. - 2023 - Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology - NIMHANS Neuropsychological Battery for Elderly in Parkinson’s Disease Patients Validation and Diagn.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In comparison with many forensic cases where date of death is typically unknown, we begin with a known postmortem interval and progressively assess, through external testing measures (temperature, skin elasticity and skin color changes) followed by photography and videography, decompositional changes over time. This work seeks to provide well-described cases with documented biological parameters to propose hypotheses for future research. Field team members observe and record any decompositional changes associated with the states of algor, rigor, and livor mortis, as well as progressive changes in skin color and tissue integrity in an environment where variability in climate and ecological factors may vary from case to case. The two cases were followed for 31 (postmortem interval [PMI] 38) and 19 (PMI 27) days in humid subtropical and tropical monsoon Köppen-Geiger classified climatic zones, respectively, where delayed decompositional and putrefactive changes observed are at odds with the anticipated rate and expected suite of biological changes occurring within an indoor permeable setting following clinical death. Within this taphonomic context, we also address the value of describing and documenting postmortem intervals in a closed subpopulation from which some individuals are recognized for exhibiting attenuated decompositional changes. This study emphasizes the importance of addressing understudied and underrepresented regions, climates, and cultural contexts for furthering research into the factors that may contribute to the understanding of the early stages of the PMI period and improve the precision of PMI estimates more broadly.","2024-07-01","2025-05-06 05:36:28","2025-05-06 05:36:28","2025-05-05 10:03:58","100370","","","9","","Forensic Science International: Reports","Delayed decompositional changes in indoor settings among Tibetan monastic communities in India","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\YT9VWQNN\Tidwell et al. - 2024 - Forensic Science International Reports - Delayed decompositional changes in indoor settings among Tibetan monastic communities in India A ca.pdf","","","Decomposition; Forensic anthropology; Forensic medicine; Forensic taphonomy; Postmortem interval","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vertical saccadic slowing is an early sign of PSP. The association between oculomotor abnormalities and sleep architecture has not been studied so far. Objectives To study the association of oculomotor abnormalities of PSP with the sleep stages by using video polysomnography (vPSG). Methods This was a cross-sectional single-center study. Twenty-two patients with PSP and 15 age and gender-matched controls were recruited. Saccades, vestibulo-ocular reflex, and optokinetic nystagmus were assessed and graded clinically in all patients and one overnight vPSG was done in all cases. Results Vertical saccades, upward more than downwards, were affected in all cases. While horizontal saccades were normal only in 41% of cases. Vertical optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) was affected in all cases. Horizontal OKN was normal in 36% of patients. The vertical upward saccades had a negative correlation with N1% and duration (r = −0.418; p = 0.05, r = −0.457; p = 0.03), N3% and duration (r = −0.486; p = 0.02, r = −0.510; p = 0.01), REM% (r = −0.449; p = 0.04), total sleep time (r = −0.487; p = 0.02) and sleep efficiency (r = −0.444; p = 0.04). There was a positive correlation between horizontal OKN and sleep onset latency (r = 0.432; p = 0.05). Conclusions Vertical saccadic restriction in PSP has significant negative correlation with total sleep time and sleep efficiency. The oculomotor and sleep abnormalities in PSP are probably interlinked and their assessment is useful in determining the characteristics of the disease.","2022-10-01","2025-05-06 05:36:27","2025-05-06 05:36:27","2025-05-05 10:03:41","34-38","","","98","","Sleep Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\35BG7TNB\Boini et al. - 2022 - Sleep Medicine - Oculomotor abnormalities and its association with sleep stages in progressive supranuclear palsy.pdf","","","Sleep; Atypical parkinsonism; Oculomotor; Progressive supranuclear palsy; Saccades","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The primary objective of the study is to comprehensively characterize the effects of two tACS protocols on resting-state EEG. Materials and Methods A total of 36 healthy participants were recruited and were randomized into three groups. Two groups received either personalized theta (4–8 Hz) or gamma (40 Hz) stimulation bilaterally in the frontal regions for 20 minutes (4 minutes ON, 1 minute OFF, four cycles). The third group performed relaxed breath watching for 20 minutes. Artifact-free, 1-minute EEG segments from the baseline, during tACS, and after stimulation resting EEG were characterized to see the effects of tACS. Threshold-free cluster enhanced permutation tests (for spectral measures) and two-way mixed analysis of variance (for aperiodic slope) were used for statistical inferences. Results Current modeling simulation using ROAST with preset parameters (800 μA, AF3 AF4 locations) showed that induced electric fields can activate frontal cortical regions. During the stimulation period, personalized theta tACS entrained theta band power in the centro-parietal areas. There was a compensatory power decrease in the beta and gamma bands after theta tACS. No entrainment effects were observed for gamma tACS during stimulation, but a significant entrainment was observed in the theta and beta bands in the parieto-occipital regions after stimulation. The delta band power decreased in the central regions. No spectral modulations were seen after breath watching. The spectral slope, which measures aperiodic activity, was not affected by either breath watching or tACS. Conclusions Characterizing the effects of multiple tACS protocols is critical to effectively target specific neural oscillatory patterns and to personalize the protocols. The study can be extended to target specific oscillatory patterns associated with cognitive deficits in neuro-psychiatric conditions.","2025-04-01","2025-05-06 05:36:26","2025-05-06 05:36:26","2025-05-05 10:03:37","425-433","","3","28","","Neuromodulation: Technology at the Neural Interface","Personalized Theta Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation and Gamma Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation Bring Differential Neuromodulatory Effects on the Resting Electroencephalogram","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","Number: 3","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\JKV7TTX9\Venugopal et al. - 2025 - Neuromodulation Technology at the Neural Interface - Personalized Theta Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation and Gamma Transcranial Alternating C.pdf","","","Current modeling; EEG frequency bands; neuromodulation; personalized protocols; tACS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The neuroscientific study of meditation has helped gain useful insights into the functional changes in the brain. In this study, we have assessed the performance of meditators with different years of practice while performing an engaging task rather than studying the meditation practice itself. This task helps assess many neural processes simultaneously and represents task performance in presence of multiple audio-visual distractors as in a real-life scenario. The long-term practice of meditation could bring neuroplastic changes in the way cognitive processing is carried out. It could be conscious and effortful in short-term practitioners and relatively unconscious and effortless in long-term practitioners. Our goal is to understand if it is possible to differentiate between long-term and short-term meditators solely based on their cognitive processing. A group of proficient Rajayoga meditators from the Brahma Kumaris were recruited based on their meditation experience—Long-Term Practitioners (n = 12, mean 13,596 h) and Short-Term Practitioners (n = 10, mean 1095 h). A task-based functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging was acquired while the subjects performed the task. Functional Connectivity Analysis was performed to derive the correlation measures to be used as features for classification. Five supervised Machine Learning algorithms Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Tree were used for classification. Among all the classifiers Gradient Boosted Tree performed the best with an accuracy of 77% when all the four Functional Connectivity Metrics were used. Connectivity in visual areas, cerebellum, left rostral prefrontal cortex, and middle frontal gyrus was found to be higher in long-term meditators. Such a classification demonstrates that long-term meditation practice brings about neuroplastic changes that influence cognitive processing.","2023-06-01","2025-05-06 05:36:25","2025-05-06 05:36:25","2025-05-05 10:03:34","305-314","","3","36","","Neuroradiol J","Differences in brain connectivity of meditators during assessing neurocognition via gamified experimental logic task","","","","","","","EN","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Number: 3 Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\4JU4RAGK\Savanth et al. - 2023 - The Neuroradiology Journal - Differences in brain connectivity of meditators during assessing neurocognition via gamified experim.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In such challenging times, it becomes crucial to identify interventions that can alleviate negative mental health outcomes, such as stress, while promoting positive mental health outcomes, like well-being. We report the effectiveness of a mind–body practise, Isha Yoga, in promoting well-being. Methods We conducted an online survey, during the COVID-19 pandemic, with Yoga practitioners (n = 1,352) from the Isha Yoga tradition in Karnataka, India. We evaluated stress and well-being attributes using conventional psychometric questionnaires. Subsequently, we requested the Isha Yoga practitioners to share another survey with their friends and family members, assessing similar outcomes. From the respondents of this shared survey (n = 221), we identified individuals who currently did not engage in any form of Yoga or meditation, constituting the non-Yoga control group (n = 110). To enhance the reliability and validity of our study and minimize the limitations commonly associated with online surveys, we adhered to the CHERRIES guidelines for reporting survey studies. Results Isha Yoga practitioners had significantly lower levels of stress (p &lt; 0.001, gHedges = 0.94) and mental distress (p &lt; 0.001, gHedges = 0.75) while reporting significantly higher levels of well-being (p &lt; 0.001, gHedges = 0.78) and affective balance (p &lt; 0.001, gHedges = 0.80) compared to the control group. Furthermore, expertise-related improvements were observed in these outcomes, and a dose–response relationship was found between regularity of Isha Yoga practice and outcome changes. A minimum 3–4 days of weekly practice showed significant differences with the control group. In addition, we investigated the effect of Isha Yoga on stress and well-being among the healthcare workers (HCWs) in our sample and observed better mental health outcomes. Discussion These findings collectively underscore the benefits of Mind and Body practices like Isha Yoga on various aspects of mental health and well-being, emphasizing its potential as an effective and holistic approach for promoting a healthy lifestyle among diverse populations, including healthcare workers, even in difficult circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","2024-02-02","2025-05-06 05:36:23","2025-05-06 05:36:23","2025-05-05 10:03:09","","","","12","","Front.

The maternal separation (MS) of rat pups constituted both separation and isolation from the littermates for three days from post-natal days 5–7 (stress hyporesponsive period, MS(SHRP)) and 16–18 (poststress hyporesponsive period, MS(PSHRP); 6 h/day) respectively. SHRP is characterized by reduced capacity to secrete stress hormone under stressful situations, which is postulated to be essential for the normal development of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. A control group consisted of rat pups never handled or separated from the mother. At postnatal day 61, the rats were exposed to a light/dark test, exploratory activity in a novel environment and passive avoidance test. Both control and MS(PSHRP) groups did not differ in the latency to enter into the dark compartment, number of transitions between light and dark compartments and total motor activities in the preferred dark chamber. However, MS(SHRP) rats exhibited increased activity in the dark chamber in the light/dark test.

Sleep disturbances including reduced REM sleep have been observed in HD. Objectives The aim of the study was to study the polysomnography findings in HD and to assess whether oculomotor abnormalities are associated with poor REM sleep. Methods Twenty-nine genetically confirmed HD patients underwent clinical evaluation including extraocular movement and OKN examination. Twenty-six patients and 15 controls underwent overnight video polysomnography (VPSG). Results VPSG of 23 HD patients and 13 controls were considered for analysis. Compared to controls, HD patients had higher median wake period and higher WASO percentage (p = 0.005). REM sleep percentage was reduced significantly in HD in comparison to controls (p < 0.001). Out of 23 patients, only two patients had REM sleep above 20% while 14 patients had REM sleep percentage less than 15%. Poor horizontal OKN (grades 2 and 3) was associated with the presence of low REM sleep percentage (REM sleep less than 15%) (p = 0.02). Low REM sleep was also associated with severe illness (UHDRS) (p = 0.038). Conclusion An association between decreased REM sleep and OKN abnormalities indicate that EOM abnormalities seen in HD could lead to errors in scoring REM sleep. To understand the actual degree of decreased REM sleep percentage will require additional parameters in AASM guidelines to score REM sleep in patients with EOM abnormalities like that seen in HD.","2022-05-01","2025-05-06 05:36:22","2025-05-08 07:02:00","2025-05-05 10:02:27","84-89","","","93","","Sleep Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\5JCZESX3\Annapureddy et al. - 2022 - Sleep Medicine - The association of saccadic abnormalities with rem sleep in patients with Huntington's disease.pdf","","#nosource","Sleep; REM sleep; Extra ocular movements; HD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have demonstrated that long-term practice of mindfulness meditation increases N3 and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stages and bring efficient autonomic modulation during sleep. In the present study, the probable humoral correlation that could bring about these changes is evaluated.   Material and Methods Long-term Vipassana meditators (n=41) and controls (n=24) (males, 30-60 years of age) underwent a two-day consecutive whole night polysomnography recording. During the second day, with exposure to 100Lux brightness, blood was sampled from the antecubital vein between 8-9 PM and in subsequent early morning. Sleep stage was scored as per American Society of Sleep Medicine (ASSM) guidelines for the second-day recording. Sleep-related hormones were estimated - melatonin by radioimmunoassay; dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), cortisol, growth hormone (GH) and prolactin with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); DHEA/cortisol ratio was calculated. Percentage of sleep stages and hormonal levels were compared between both groups using independent ‘t’ test and Pearson’s correlation was estimated between sleep stages and hormonal levels.   Results Meditators showed increased N3, REM sleep stages. Though evening cortisol was comparable between the two groups; early morning cortisol, diurnal DHEA and melatonin were significantly higher in meditators. Diurnal DHEA correlated significantly with the N3 sleep stage in meditators.   Discussion Higher diurnal DHEA despite variations in corresponding cortisol in meditators demonstrates that long-term Vipassana meditation practice modulates the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and thereby influences sleep. Thus, the study provides evidence to explore the mechanism most likely involved with mindfulness meditation intervention in insomnia.","2023-12-01","2025-05-06 05:36:21","2025-05-06 05:36:21","2025-05-05 10:00:57","179-187","","","15","","","","","","","","","","en","Thieme Revinter Publicações Ltda.

Oculomotor abnormality is one of the most frequent manifestations. This study was done to assess the polysomnographic abnormalities in patients with Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1, SCA2 and SCA3) and also to evaluate whether oculomotor abnormalities interfere with sleep stage R scoring. Methods The study was carried out using 36 genetically positive SCA patients. All patients underwent neurological examination with special focus on oculomotor function (optokinetic nystagmus-OKN and extraocular movement restriction-EOM). The sleep quality was measured with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Disease severity was assessed with International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). All the patients underwent over-night video-polysomnography (VPSG). Results Out of 36 patients studied, the data of 34 patients [SCA1 (n = 12), SCA2 (n = 13), SCA3 (n = 9)] were used for final analysis. Patients from SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3 category did not show significant differences in age and diseases severity (ICARS). All patients had vertical OKN impairment. Oculomotor impairment was higher in SCA2 patients. Sleep macro-architecture analysis showed absent stage R sleep, predominantly in SCA2 (69%) followed by SCA3 (44%) and SCA1 (8%). Patients showed a strong negative correlation of stage R sleep percentage with disease severity and oculomotor dysfunction. Conclusion Voluntary saccadic eye movement velocity and rapid eye movements (REMs) in sleep are strongly correlated. The more severe the saccadic velocity impairment, the less likely was it to generate REMs (rapid eye movements) during stage R. Accordingly 69% of SCA2 patients with severe occulomotor impairments showed absent stage R as per the AASM sleep scoring. We presume that the impaired REMs generation in sleep could be due to oculomotor abnormality and has resulted in spuriously low or absent stage R sleep percentage in SCA patients with conventional VPSG scoring rules. The present study recommends the modification of AASM scoring rules for stage R in patients with oculomotor abnormalities.","2018-02-01","2025-05-06 05:36:20","2025-05-08 07:02:01","2025-05-05 09:59:52","97-102","","","42","","Sleep Medicine","Challenges in sleep stage R scoring in patients with autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, SCA2 and SCA3) and oculomotor abnormalities","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\MJMGIE5Z\Seshagiri et al. - 2018 - Sleep Medicine - Challenges in sleep stage R scoring in patients with autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA.pdf","","#nosource","Occulomotor abnormalities; Polysomnography; Rapid eye movement; Spinocerebellar ataxia; Stage R scoring rules","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study was done to evaluate and compare the SS densities (SSDs) of genetically proven autosomal dominant SCA1, SCA2 and SCA3 patients with controls. Methods: Prospectively and genetically confirmed cases of SCA and controls were recruited. Patients were assessed clinically, were evaluated with sleep questionnaires and an overnight polysomnography was performed. SSDs were analyzed using neuroloop gain plugin of Polyman version 1.15 software. Results: Eighteen patients of SCA1 (n = 6), SCA2 (n = 5), SCA3 (n = 7) and 6 controls were recruited in our study. The mean age of SCA1 patients was 39.2 ± 5.4, of SCA2 patients was 30.8 ± 9.5 and of SCA3 patients was 35.4 ± 6.4 years. The mean duration of illness in SCA1 was 4.7 ± 1.7 years, in SCA2 it was 4.3 ± 4.4 years and in SCA3 it was 5 ± 2.3 years. The median SSD values (percentage loop gain) during stage 2 of non-rapid eye movement sleep were 16.9% in SCA1, 0% in SCA2, 1.2% in SCA3 and 59.5% in controls. There was a significant difference in SSD values in SCA2 (p = 0.04), SCA3 (p = 0.02) patients and controls. Conclusion: SSDs were significantly decreased in patients with SCA, which is a novel finding. This is likely due to the “thalamic switch” disruption, observed as reduced SSDs in SCA2 and SCA3. Sleep spindle deficits could act as one of the biomarkers of ongoing neurodegeneration in the thalamic circuitry of SCA patients.","2018-03-08","2025-05-06 05:36:18","2025-05-06 05:36:18","2025-05-05 09:58:20","106-111","","2","25","","Annals of Neurosciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","Number: 2","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\FVUDUVEX\Seshagiri et al. - 2018 - Annals of Neurosciences - Assessment of Sleep Spindle Density among Genetically Positive Spinocerebellar Ataxias Types 1, 2, a.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studying this phenomenon using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-susceptible C57BL/6J, MPTP-resistant CD-1 and their resistant crossbred mice revealed differences in the nigrostriatal cyto-molecular features. Here, we investigated the electrophysiological and behavioural correlates for differential MPTP-susceptibility and their outcome upon admixing. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from dorsal striatum and assessed motor co-ordination using rotarod and grip strength measures. Nigral calbindin-D28K expression, a regulator of striatal activity through nigrostriatal projections was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. The crossbreds had significantly higher baseline striatal LFPs. MPTP significantly increased the neuronal activity in delta (0.5–4 Hz) and low beta (12–16 Hz) ranges in C57BL/6J; significant increase across frequency bands till high beta (0.5–30 Hz) in CD-1, and caused no alterations in crossbreds. MPTP further depleted the already low nigral calbindin-D28K expression in C57BL/6J. While in crossbreds, it was further up-regulated. MPTP affected the rotarod and grip strength performance of the C57BL/6J, while the injected CD-1 and crossbreds performed well. The increased striatal β-oscillations are comparable to that in PD patients. Higher power in CD-1 may be compensatory in nature, which were also reported in pre-symptomatic monkeys. Concurrent up-regulation of nigral calbindin-D28K may assist maintenance of striatal activity by buffering calcium overload in nigra. Thus, preserved motor behaviour in PD reminiscent conditions in CD-1 and crossbreds complement compensated/unaffected striatal LFPs. Similar electrophysiological correlates and cytomorphological features are envisaged in human phenomenon of differential PD prevalence, which are modulated upon admixing.","2019-03-15","2025-05-06 05:36:18","2025-05-06 05:36:18","2025-05-05 09:58:16","216-227","","","360","","Behavioural Brain Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\TY8RM8AR\Vidyadhara et al. - 2019 - Behavioural Brain Research - Admixing MPTP-resistant and MPTP-vulnerable mice enhances striatal field potentials and calbindin-D2.pdf","","","Substantia nigra pars compacta; Admixing; C57BL/6J and CD-1 mice; Calbindin-D28K; Grip strength; Local field potentials; MPTP; Parkinson disease; Rotarod; Striatum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) were extensively investigated for their role in neuroregeneration. However, drawbacks like painful bone marrow extraction, less proliferation and poor CNS engraftment following systemic injections of BM-MSC prompt us to search for alternate/appropriate source of MSC for treating ND. In this context, dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) could be an alternative to BM-MSC as it possess both mesenchymal and neural characteristic features due to its origin from ectoderm, ease of isolation, higher proliferation index and better neuroprotection. A study on the migration potential of DPSC compared to BM-MSC in a neurodegenerative condition is warranted. Given the neural crest origin, we hypothesize that DPSC possess better migration towards neurodegenerative milieu as compared to BM-MSC. In this prospect, we investigated the migration potential of DPSC in an in vitro neurodegenerative condition. Towards this, transwell, Matrigel and chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) migration assays were carried-out by seeding hippocampal neurons in the lower chamber and treated with 300 μM kainic acid (KA) for 6 h to induce neurodegeneration. Subsequently, the upper chamber of transwell was loaded with DPSC/BM-MSC and their migration potential was assessed following 24 h of incubation. Our results revealed that the migration potential of DPSC/BM-MSC was comparable in non-degenerative condition. However, following injury the migration potential of DPSC towards the degenerating site was significantly higher as compared to BM-MSC. Furthermore, upon exposure of naïve DPSC/BM-MSCs to culture medium derived from neurodegenerative milieu resulted in significant upregulation of homing factors like SDF-1alpha, CXCR-4, VCAM-1, VLA-4, CD44, MMP-2 suggesting that the superior migration potential of DPSC might be due to prompt expression of homing factors in DPSC compared to BM-MSCs.","2020-12-01","2025-05-06 05:36:12","2025-05-06 05:36:12","2025-05-05 09:57:17","89-100","","","81","","NeuroToxicology","Remarkable migration propensity of dental pulp stem cells towards neurodegenerative milieu","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\CNMEBY88\Senthilkumar et al. - 2020 - NeuroToxicology - Remarkable migration propensity of dental pulp stem cells towards neurodegenerative milieu An in.pdf","","","Hippocampus; Neurodegeneration; Dental pulp stem cells; Mesenchymal stem cells; Migration; Stromal cell derived factor-alpha","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lesioned rats exposed to enriched housing showed behavioral recovery in the 8-arm radial maze but not in the water maze. Our study suggests the possibility that recovery may be based on the functional demand of spatial tasks and may require more appropriate environmental stimulation.","2005-11-30","2025-05-06 05:36:08","2025-05-06 05:36:08","2025-05-05 09:17:16","121-131","","2","1063","","Brain Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","Number: 2","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\NIBJMKGX\Bindu et al. - 2005 - Brain Research - Post insult enriched housing improves the 8-arm radial maze performance but not the Morris water maz.pdf","","","Ventral subicular lesion; Behavioral recovery; Enriched housing; Impairment; Spatial task","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Interestingly, few data exist on the pathway(s) such as TLR and inflammasome, primarily involved in sensing the microorganisms and inducing downstream inflammatory responses, apoptosis and neuroprogressive changes that drive prenatal infection-induced risk of schizophrenia. Herein, we aimed to discern whether prenatal infection-induced maternal immune activation (MIA) causes schizophrenia-like behaviours through activation of TLR and inflammasome pathways in the brain of offspring. Sprague Dawley rats (n=15/group) were injected either with poly (I:C) or LPS or saline at gestational day (GD)-12. Significantly elevated plasma levels of IL-6, TNF-α and IL-17A assessed after 24 hours were observed in both the poly (I:C) and LPS-treated rats, while IL-1β was only elevated in LPS-treated rats, indicating MIA. The offspring of poly (I:C)-and LPS-treated dams displayed increased anxiety-like behaviours, deficits in social behaviours and prepulse inhibition. The hippocampus of offspring rats showed increased expression of Tlr3, Tlr4, Nlrp3, Il1b, and Il18 of poly (I:C) and Tlr4, Nlrp3, Cas1, Il1b, and Il18 of LPS-treated dams. Furthermore, Tlr and inflammasome genes were associated with social deficits and impaired prepulse inhibition in offspring rats. The results suggest that MIA due to prenatal infection can trigger TLR and inflammasome pathways and enhances the risk of schizophrenia-like behaviours in the later stages of life of the offspring.","2021-11-01","2025-05-06 05:36:07","2025-05-06 05:36:07","2025-05-05 09:17:12","48-61","","","52","","European Neuropsychopharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\EKBHID75\Talukdar et al. - 2021 - European Neuropsychopharmacology - A proof-of-concept study of maternal immune activation mediated induction of Toll-like receptor (TLR.pdf","","","Maternal immune activation; Schizophrenia; Inflammasome; Neuroprogression; Toll-like receptor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although several studies have examined functional activation and connectivity in long-term as well as short-term meditators from different meditation traditions, it is unclear if long-term meditation practice brings about distinct changes in network properties of brain functional connectivity that persist during task performance. Indeed, task-based functional connectivity studies of meditators are rare. Aims: This study aimed to differentiate between long-term and short-term Rajayoga meditators based on functional connectivity between regions of interest in the brain. Task-based fMRI was captured as the meditators performed an engaging task. The graph theoretical-based functional connectivity measures of task-based fMRI were calculated using CONN toolbox and were used as features to classify the two groups using Machine Learning models. Subjects and Methods: In this study, we recruited two age and sex-matched groups of Rajayoga meditators from the Brahma Kumaris tradition that differed in the duration of their meditation experience: Long-term practitioners (n = 12, mean 13,596 h) and short-term practitioners (n = 10, mean 1095 h). fMRI data were acquired as they performed an engaging task and functional connectivity metrics were calculated from this data. These metrics were used as features in training machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we used adjacency matrices generated from graph measures, global efficiency, and local efficiency, as features. We computed functional connectivity with 132 ROIs as well as 32 network ROIs. Statistical Analysis Used: Five machine learning models, such as logistic regression, SVM, decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosted tree, were trained to classify the two groups. Accuracy, precision, sensitivity, selectivity, area under the curve receiver operating characteristics curve were used as performance measures. Results: The graph measures were effective features, and tree-based algorithms such as decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosted tree yielded the best performance (test accuracy >84% with 132 ROIs) in classifying the two groups of meditators. Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that long-term meditative practices alter brain functional connectivity networks even in nonmeditative contexts. Further, the use of adjacency matrices from graph theoretical measures of high-dimensional fMRI data yields a promising feature set for machine learning classifiers.","2022-05","2025-05-08 06:06:57","2025-05-08 06:06:57","2025-05-08 06:06:57","96-105","","2","15","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\Q6K2R6UD\Savanth et al. - 2022 - International Journal of Yoga - Classification of Rajayoga Meditators Based on the Duration of Practice Using Graph Theoretical Meas.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Earlier we demonstrated deficits in sociability and social novelty as a measure of social cognition in ventral subicular lesioned (VSL) rats. The present study investigated empathy-like pro-social behavior and the associated affective states in VSL rats. The ability of free rats to release trapped cagemates was assessed using a modified door-opening empathy task. The rat pairs (free rat and the trapped cagemate) used were from the same group and tested for eight days to assess the pro-social behavior displayed by the free rats. The controlfree rats learned to open the door quickly to release the trapped cagemate and both the rats displayed social responses by emitting ‘hedonic’ calls (50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations) while playing after the release. The VSLfree rats, however, were less exploratory, displayed apathy towards the trapped cagemate, demonstrated freezing behavior following door-opening and did not interact with the cagemate even after its release. These findings indicate deficits of social motivation and reinforcement learning associated with lesions in possibly both the rats. In addition, the VSL rat pairs elicited more 22-kHz ‘alarm’ calls and fewer 50-kHz ‘hedonic’ calls highlighting the lesion-induced alterations of contextual processing and threat perception abilities. In conclusion, VSL led to significant pro-social deficits implicating the role of ventral subiculum in social cognition and empathy. More studies are needed to substantiate whether the subiculum is implicated in social deficits associated with psychiatric conditions such as autism spectrum disorder.","2022-04","2025-05-08 06:07:00","2025-05-08 06:07:00","2025-05-08 06:07:00","136535","","","776","","Neuroscience Letters","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\Q2PW3FCE\Subhadeep et al. - 2022 - Neuroscience Letters - Ventral subicular lesion impairs pro-social empathy-like behavior in adult Wistar rats.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the cellular and molecular underpinnings of phototherapy-mediated functional recovery are yet to be studied. The present study examines the effectiveness of short photoperiod regime (SPR; 6:18-h light:dark cycle) in restoring the cognitive functions in ventral subicular lesioned rats. Bilateral ventral subicular lesion (VSL) resulted in significant impairment of spatial navigational abilities when tested in the Morris water maze (MWM) task. Further, VSL resulted in reduced expression of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and activity-regulated cytoskeletal (Arc) protein and suppression of neurogenesis in the hippocampus. VSL also suppressed the magnitude of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. However, exposure to SPR for 21 days showed significant restoration of spatial performance in the MWM task as the ventral subicular lesioned rats could deploy higher cognitive allocentric navigational strategies to reach the hidden platform. Further, SPR resulted in enhanced expression of hippocampal GR and Arc protein and neurogenesis but not hippocampal LTP suggestive of appropriate need-based SPR intervention. In conclusion, the study demonstrates the effectiveness of SPR in establishing functional recovery as well as the possible molecular and cellular basis of cognitive recovery in a rat model of neurodegeneration. Such studies provide a framework in understanding the efficacy of non-pharmacological strategies in establishing functional recovery in neurodegenerative conditions.","2021-09","2025-05-08 06:07:10","2025-05-08 06:07:10","2025-05-08 06:07:10","4437-4459","","9","58","","Mol Neurobiol","Exposure to Short Photoperiod Regime Restores Spatial Cognition in Ventral Subicular Lesioned Rats","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\U3IJSCBY\Subhadeep et al. - 2021 - Molecular Neurobiology - Exposure to Short Photoperiod Regime Restores Spatial Cognition in Ventral Subicular Lesioned Rats.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the cellular basis of beneficial effects of EE remains unknown. Accordingly, in the current study, we evaluated the effects of EE in chronic epilepsy-induced changes in behavioral hyperexcitability, synaptic transmission, synaptophysin (SYN), and calbindin (CB) expression, hippocampal subfield volumes and cell density in male Wistar rats. Epilepsy was induced by lithium–pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. Chronic epilepsy resulted in behavioral hyperexcitability, decreased basal synaptic transmission, increased paired-pulse facilitation ratio, decreased hippocampal subfields volumes. Moreover, epileptic rats showed decreased synaptophysin and CB expression in the hippocampus. Six weeks post-SE, epileptic rats were exposed to EE for 2 weeks, 6 hr/ day. EE significantly reduced the behavioral hyperexcitability and restored basal synaptic transmission correlating with increased expression of SYN and CB. Our results reaffirm the beneficial effects of EE on behavior in chronic epilepsy and establishes some of the putative cellular mechanisms. Since drug resistance and comorbidities are a major concern in TLE, we propose EE as a potent non-pharmacological treatment modality to mitigate these changes in chronic epilepsy.","2021-06","2025-05-08 06:07:13","2025-05-14 10:13:16","2025-05-08 06:07:13","1646-1665","","6","99","","J of Neuroscience Research","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\PVP8THUU\Salaka et al. - 2021 - Journal of Neuroscience Research - Enriched environment ameliorates chronic temporal lobe epilepsy‐induced behavioral hyperexcitability.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, we have studied the impact of VSL on sleep–wake behavioral patterns and the effect of SPR on sleep–wakefulness behavior. Adult male Wistar rats subjected to VSL demonstrated decreased wake duration and enhanced total sleep time due to increased non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS). Power spectral analysis indicated increased delta activity during NREMS and decreased sigma band power during all vigilance states. Light is one of the strongest entrainers of the circadian rhythm, and its manipulation may have various physiological and functional consequences. We investigated the effect of 21-day exposure to SPR on sleep–wakefulness (S–W) behavior in VSL rats. We observed that SPR exposure restored S–W behavior in VSL rats, resulting in an increase in wake duration and a significant increase in theta power during wake and REMS. This study highlights the crucial role of the ventral subiculum in maintaining normal sleep–wakefulness patterns and highlights the effectiveness of photoperiod manipulation as a non-pharmacological treatment for reversing sleep disturbances reported in mood and neuropsychiatric disorders like Alzheimer's disease, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder, which also involve alterations in circadian rhythm.","2024-07","2025-05-08 06:12:00","2025-05-14 10:12:52","2025-05-08 06:12:00","e25367","","7","102","","J of Neuroscience Research","Restoration of sleep–wake behavior following short photoperiod exposure in ventral subicular lesioned male Wistar rats","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\6KGTU37I\Prem et al. - 2024 - Journal of Neuroscience Research - Restoration of sleep–wake behavior following short photoperiod exposure in ventral subicular lesione.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present epidemiological study measured various aspects of sleep disturbance such as sleep quality, daytime impairments, negative emotionality, sleep hygiene, and wellbeing associated with CoVID-19 pandemic among the Indian population. Methods: This cross-sectional voluntary online survey (using Google form) was communicated across the country from 4th June to 3rd July 2020 through mail and social media applications. The responses received (N ¼ 450) were categorized and validated using the latent class analysis and logistic regression tests respectively, and the classes and subclasses derived were proﬁled. These techniques are used for the ﬁrst time in a CoVID-19 sleep study. Results: Out of the three classes derived from the LCA, people with severe dyssomnia belonging to class 1 (33.3%) showed high daytime impairments, negative emotionality and high vulnerability towards CoVID19 pandemic measures. In addition, the two subclasses derived from the severe dyssomnia group; one with negative emotionality predominance and the other with excessive daytime sleepiness, were similarly affected by CoVID-19 measures. People with moderate dyssomnia (class 2, 28.5%) showed frequent arousals with daytime impairments and the majority (38.2%) which fell in to class 3, the ‘no dyssomnia’ category, were not impacted by CoVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: People with existing sleep problems or those who were vulnerable to the same were the ones affected by CoVID-19 pandemic. Those with inadequate emotional coping styles have showed heightened vulnerability. Proper medical and cognitive interventions are highly recommended for this population. No or moderate dyssomnia categories (class 3 and 2 respectively) were less impacted by CoVID-19.","2021-03","2025-05-08 06:12:36","2025-05-08 06:12:36","2025-05-08 06:12:36","29-39","","","79","","Sleep Medicine","People with dyssomnia showed increased vulnerability to CoVID-19 pandemic","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\X679TPGD\Radhakrishnan et al. - 2021 - Sleep Medicine - People with dyssomnia showed increased vulnerability to CoVID-19 pandemic a questionnaire-based stu.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The neurodevelopmental origin is one of the most widely recognized etiological models of this heterogeneous disorder. Environmental factors, especially infections during gestation, appear to be a major risk determinant of neurodevelopmental basis of schizophrenia. Prenatal infection may cause maternal immune activation (MIA) and enhance risk of schizophrenia in the offspring. However, the precise mechanistic basis through which MIA causes long-lasting schizophrenia-like behavioral deficits in offspring remains inadequately understood. Herein, we aimed to delineate whether prenatal infection-induced MIA causes schizophrenia-like behaviors through its long-lasting effects on immune-inflammatory and apoptotic pathways, oxidative stress toxicity, and antioxidant defenses in the brain of offspring. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups (n = 15/group) and were injected with poly (I:C), LPS, and saline at gestational day (GD)-12. Except IL-1β, plasma levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-17A assessed after 24 h were significantly elevated in both the poly (I:C)- and LPS-treated pregnant rats, indicating MIA. The rats born to dams treated with poly (I:C) and LPS displayed increased anxiety-like behaviors and significant deficits in social behaviors. Furthermore, the hippocampus of the offspring rats of both the poly (I:C)- and LPS-treated groups showed increased signs of lipid peroxidation, diminished total antioxidant content, and differentially upregulated expression of inflammatory (TNFα, IL6, and IL1β), and apoptotic (Bax, Cas3, and Cas9) genes but decreased expression of neuroprotective (BDNF and Bcl2) genes. The results suggest long-standing effects of prenatal infections on schizophrenia-like behavioral deficits, which are mediated by immune-inflammatory and apoptotic pathways, increased oxidative stress toxicity, and lowered antioxidant and neuroprotective defenses. The findings suggest that prenatal infections may underpin neurodevelopmental aberrations and neuroprogression and subsequently schizophrenia-like symptoms.","2020-10","2025-05-08 06:12:41","2025-05-08 06:12:41","2025-05-08 06:12:41","4345-4361","","10","57","","Mol Neurobiol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\W8KBARHP\Talukdar et al. - 2020 - Molecular Neurobiology - Maternal Immune Activation Causes Schizophrenia-like Behaviors in the Offspring through Activation o.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Circadian rhythm manipulations are potentially effective non-pharmacological strategies in the management of central nervous system insults. In our previous study, we demonstrated the efficacy of short photoperiod regime (SPR; 06/18 hr light-dark cycle) in establishing functional recovery in ventral subicular lesion (VSL) rats. The present study further demonstrates the efficacy of SPR in mitigating anxiety and depression as well as facilitating socio-cognitive behavior in VSL rats. VSL elevated the basal plasma corticosterone levels, increased anxiety, anhedonia, and behavioral despair with decreased self-care. The VSL rats also exhibited a considerable degree of impaired social cognition, in terms of altered social preference and social novelty. Exposure to SPR for 21 days mitigated the anxiety- and depressive-like phenotypes as well as improved social cognition significantly. Thus, the study demonstrated the effectiveness of SPR strategy in reversing most of the behavioral deficits caused by VSL. SPR, perhaps, would have regulated the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis responsiveness as we observed a decrease in plasma corticosterone levels following SPR in VSL rats. The study implies the need for developing a task-dependent SPR strategy to achieve complete behavioral recovery as the functional demands of each behavior is distinct. In summary, the study highlights the efficacy of photoperiod manipulation as a novel, non-pharmacological approach in mitigating the affective and cognitive deficits associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder and Alzheimer's disease wherein circadian rhythm alterations are implicated.","2020-06","2025-05-08 06:12:43","2025-05-14 10:13:37","2025-05-08 06:12:43","1114-1136","","6","98","","J of Neuroscience Research","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\B6J7IJZU\Subhadeep et al. - 2020 - Journal of Neuroscience Research - Short photoperiod restores ventral subicular lesion‐induced deficits in affective and socio‐cognitiv.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesized that noninvasive tools like transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and acoustic stimulation (for generating event related potentials [ERPs]) would help to predict sleep stability and provide a window to actively assess brain activity during sleep. Materials and Methods: Twelve healthy male volunteers participated in the multiple whole-night polysomnography (PSG) recording protocol. Acoustic tones (100 msec duration) were presented throughout night to evaluate ERP during sleep. Furthermore, 30 sec tACS were presented during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep on subsequent two nights without disturbing the subject’s sleep. For ERP analysis, event-locked artifact-free epochs from each sleep stage were averaged separately. For tACS analysis, 30 sec prestimulus and poststimulus artifact-free EEG epochs were subjected to bootstrapping-based comparison of power spectral values. Results: Acoustic stimulation generated sleep stage-dependent ERP components (N350, N550, and P900) in all participants. The tACS stimulation during NREM sleep (0.75 Hz) increased parietal delta power but decreased frontocentral theta and increased frontal gamma power when delivered during REM sleep (40Hz). These interventions provide details on sleep stability as larger N550-P900 ERP-complex correlated with lower NREM disruptions (Spearman’s rho = −0.553; p = 0.049; n = 10) and tACS-related theta power perturbation with higher REM disruptions (Spearman’s rho = 0.734; p = 0.030; n = 7).

The early life stress was induced by exposing rat pups to 6 h of maternal separation and isolation (MS) stress from postnatal days 4–14 i.e. during SHRP period. The long-term impact of MS in these rats was evaluated by assessing anxiety, sociability, social preference, spatial learning and memory along with a detailed evaluation of attentional functions during young adulthood period. Adult male MS rats showed increased anxiety-like behaviour, impaired flexibility in social interactions, and increased reward-seeking behaviour. MS rats also showed faster spatial learning in the partially baited radial arm maze and exhibited moderately enhanced sustained attention in the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5CSRTT). These results suggest that early MS has both positive and negative consequences in adulthood. Increased cognitive ability in MS rats, as evidenced by the improved sustained attention and spatial learning and memory, is usually advantageous and indicates positive influences of early stressors that might lead to the development of resilience and enhanced compensatory mechanisms later in adulthood. MS stress has compromised flexibility in social behaviour that promotes solitary lifestyle and social isolation. Heightened reward-seeking behaviour, as shown by the MS rats, could be a predisposing factor for substance abuse and addiction. Thus, our study highlights the crucial and differential impact of early life challenges on behaviour during adulthood and suggests that the positive aspects could be an asset that may be utilized to suppress the negative effects of early life stress in adulthood.","2019-08","2025-05-08 06:12:49","2025-05-08 06:12:49","2025-05-08 06:12:49","1993-2010","","8","237","","Exp Brain Res","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\RJYYK28Z\Kambali et al. - 2019 - Experimental Brain Research - Effect of early maternal separation stress on attention, spatial learning and social interaction beh.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MS stress was induced by exposing rat pups into maternal separation followed by isolation stress from peer groups (MS) daily/6 h during stress hyporesponsive period, while controls rats that were undisturbed during this period are called NMS rats. 5, 8, 15 and 52 weeks later, these animals were exposed to classical fear conditioning test by pairing auditory stimulus (conditioned stimulus, CS+) with electric footshock. 24 h later, conditioned freezing response to CS+ was measured during fear retention, extinction and extinction recall trials. The normal ageing per se did not aﬀect the formation of fear memory, retention and fear extinction memory. MS stress, on the other hand, disrupted fear memory at young adulthood age exhibiting increased freezing response to CS+ during retention test and reduced during fear extinction memory test when compared to NMS groups. On the other hand, rats at adolescence age exhibited reduced freezing during fear retention and enhanced freezing response to CS+ during extinction recall test. However, MS-induced changes in freezing response during fear retention and extinction tests were not seen in adulthood and 1-year-old age groups. These data demonstrate the young adulthood age is highly vulnerable to fear memory and extinction processes. The diﬀerences in freezing response to CS+ during fear conditioning from adolescence to old age, thus, appear to be related to the maturation of the limbic circuit.","2019-01","2025-05-08 06:12:56","2025-05-08 06:12:57","2025-05-08 06:12:56","181-190","","1","237","","Exp Brain Res","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\EPXDN3BC\Mishra et al. - 2019 - Experimental Brain Research - The impact of maternal separation and isolation stress during stress hyporesponsive period on fear r.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Intact attentional processing is crucial for the development of social and communication skills. Deficits in attention are therefore likely contributors to the core pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Clinical evidence in ASD is suggestive of impairments in attention and its control, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We examined sustained, spatially divided attention in a prenatal valproic acid (VPA) model of ASD using the 5‐choice serial reaction time task (5‐CSRTT). As compared to controls, male and female VPA rats had progressively lower accuracy and higher omissions with increasing attentional demands during 5‐CSRTT training, and showed further performance decrements when subjected to parametric task manipulations. It is noteworthy that although VPA exposure induced attentional deficits in both sexes, there were task parameter specific sex differences. Importantly, we did not find evidence of impulsivity or motivational deficits in VPA rats but we did find reduced social preference, as well as sensorimotor deficits that suggest pre‐attentional information processing impairments. Importantly, with fixed rules, graded difficulty levels, and more time, VPA rats could be successfully trained on the attentional task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study examining attentional functions in a VPA model. Our work underscores the need for studying both sexes in ASD animal models and validates the use of the VPA model in the quest for mechanistic understanding of aberrant attentional functions and for evaluating suitable therapeutic targets.

Results: PSZ showed macro-sleep architecture abnormalities such as prolonged sleeplessness, increased intermittent-awakenings, long sleep-onset latency, reduced nonrapid-eye-movement (NREM) stage 2 sleep, increased stage transitions, and poor sleep efficiency. They also showed reduced spindle density (sigma neuroloop-gain) but comparable slow wave density (delta neuroloop-gain) throughout the sleep.

Accordingly, the present study evaluated the effects of EE on chronic epilepsy–induced alterations in cognitive functions, electrophysiology, and cellular changes in the hippocampus.","2017-07","2025-05-08 06:13:21","2025-05-08 06:13:21","2025-05-08 06:13:21","1148-1158","","7","58","","Epilepsia","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\GFU88QX4\Vrinda et al. - 2017 - Epilepsia - Enriched environment attenuates behavioral seizures and depression in chronic temporal lobe epilepsy.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ANGEL employs an audiovisual sensory motor design for the acquisition of multiple event related potentials (ERPs)—the C1, P50, MMN, N1, N170, P2, N2pc, LRP, P300, and ERN. The ANGEL paradigm allows assessment of 10 neurocognitive variables over the course of three “game” levels of increasing complexity ranging from simple passive observation to complex discrimination and response in the presence of multiple distractors. The paradigm allows assessment of several levels of rapid decision making: speeded up response vs. response-inhibition; responses to easy vs. difﬁcult tasks; responses based on gestalt perception of clear vs. ambiguous stimuli; and ﬁnally, responses with set shifting during challenging tasks. The paradigm has been tested using 18 healthy participants from both sexes and the possibilities of varied data analyses have been presented in this paper. The ANGEL approach provides an ecologically valid assessment (as compared to existing tools) that quickly yields a very rich dataset and helps to assess multiple ERPs that can be studied extensively to assess cognitive functions in health and disease conditions.","2016-01-29","2025-05-08 06:13:30","2025-05-08 06:13:30","2025-05-08 06:13:30","","","","10","","Front.

In the working memory control condition, maximal activations were noted in the left dorsal anterior insula. Conclusions Activation of the bilateral dorsal anterior insula, a component of the central salience network, was found to be unique to this ‘endogenous-cue prospective memory task’ in comparison to previously reported exogenous- and endogenous-cue prospective memory tasks without incremental working memory updating.

Moreover, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep plays an important role in integrating new information with the previously stored emotional experience. Hence, the impact of early maternal separation and isolation stress (MS) during the stress hyporesponsive period (SHRP) on fear memory retention and sleep in rats were studied. The neonatal rats were subjected to maternal separation and isolation stress during postnatal days 5–7 (6 h daily/3 d). Polysomnographic recordings and differential fear conditioning was carried out in two different sets of rats aged 2 months. The neuronal replay during REM sleep was analyzed using different parameters. MS rats showed increased time in REM stage and total sleep period also increased. MS rats showed fear generalization with increased fear memory retention than normal control (NC). The detailed analysis of the local ﬁeld potentials across different time periods of REM sleep showed increased theta oscillations in the hippocampus, amygdala and cortical circuits. Our ﬁndings suggest that stress during SHRP has sensitized the hippocampus–amygdala–cortical loops which could be due to increased release of corticosterone that generally occurs during REM sleep. These rats when subjected to fear conditioning exhibit increased fear memory and increased fear generalization. The development of helplessness, anxiety and sleep changes in human patients, thus, could be related to the reduced thermal, tactile and social stimulation during SHRP on brain plasticity and fear memory functions.","2014-10","2025-05-08 06:13:37","2025-05-08 06:13:37","2025-05-08 06:13:37","144-154","","","273","","Behavioural Brain Research","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\CLIU4BUH\Sampath et al. - 2014 - Behavioural Brain Research - A study on fear memory retrieval and REM sleep in maternal separation and isolation stressed rats.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ChAT immunocytochemical studies showed sparse distribution of cholinergic ﬁbers in the ventral subiculum conﬁrming the cholinergic elimination to ventral subiculum.

Manasamitra Vataka (an Ayurveda preparation) is explored for its efﬁcacy in patients with GAD with comorbid generalized social phobia. Materials and methods: Seventy-two (72) patients with GAD with comorbid social phobia meeting DSM IV TR criteria, and who were between the ages of 20 and 55 of either sex, participated in the study. They were randomly divided into three treatment groups: Group 1 (n = 24) and Group II (n = 24) received Manasamitra Vataka tablets (100 mg twice daily for 30 days). Group II, in addition to Manasamitra Vataka, underwent Shirodhara (therapy involving dripping of medicated oil [Brahmi tail] over the forehead) treatment for the ﬁrst 7 days. Group III (n = 24) received clonazepam 0.75 mg daily in divided dose for 30 days. The assessment of the study was done using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), World Health Organization Quality of Life BREF, and Clinical Global Impression scales (Improvement and Efﬁcacy). Results: Patients from all the groups showed signiﬁcant reduction in clinical parameters evaluated. However, improvement in ESS was observed only in Group II. The treatment outcome was comparable between the three groups. Conclusions: This is the ﬁrst study conducted on the efﬁcacy of Manasamitra Vataka in anxiety disorders. The results suggest that Manasamitra Vataka is effective in the management GAD with comorbid generalized social phobia. Add-on effect of Shirodhara reduced the daytime sleepiness. Further studies on Manasamitra Vataka need to be carried out to judge its potential as a ﬁrst-line treatment modality.","2012-06","2025-05-08 06:13:46","2025-05-14 09:13:59","2025-05-08 06:13:46","612-621","","6","18","","The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine","Clinical Efficacy of <i>Manasamitra Vataka</i> (an Ayurveda Medication) on Generalized Anxiety Disorder with Comorbid Generalized Social Phobia","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\Q4P7PSZ4\Tubaki et al. - 2012 - The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine - Clinical Efficacy of Manasamitra Vataka (an Ayurveda Medication) on Generalized Anxiety Disor.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have investigated the effect of acute immobilization stress in amygdalohippocampal circuits by measuring the electroencephalogram (EEG) in male Wistar rats during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Electrodes were implanted stereotaxically in the hippocampus (CA1 and CA3 subregions of the hippocampus) and the amygdala (lateral nucleus). Prior to the stress, two baseline recordings were taken. Twenty-four hours later rats were exposed once to acute immobilization stress (AIS) session for 2 h. After the release and on subsequent days, electrophysiological changes that occurred due to stress during REM sleep were analyzed by comparing them with baseline measurements. Our results suggest that acute immobilization stress induced signiﬁcant increase in REM sleep in the ﬁrst 24 h after the exposure.

The REM sleep-organization was significantly different in senior meditators with more number of REM episodes and increased duration of each episode, distinct changes in rapid eye movement activity (REMA) dynamics due to increased phasic and tonic activity and enhanced burst events (sharp and slow bursts) during the second and fourth REM episodes.

Changes in REM sleep-organization among the senior practitioners of meditation could be attributed to the intense brain plasticity events associated with intense meditative practices on brain functions.","2016-06","2025-05-08 06:18:46","2025-05-08 06:18:46","","279-287","","3","28","","Int Rev Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27055575","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\LCYRYJH6\Maruthai et al. - 2016 - International Review of Psychiatry (Abingdon, England) - Senior Vipassana Meditation practitioners exhibit distinct REM sleep organization from that of novic.pdf","","","Vipassana meditation; Meditation; Male; REM sleep; Polysomnography; Electroencephalography; Adult; Humans; Middle Aged; phasic and tonic REM; rapid eye movement activity (REMA).; REM burst; Sleep, REM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Certain antioxidant agents such as dietary polyphenols, taken in adequate quantities, have been suggested to improve the cognitive processes. In this study, we examined the effect of oral administration of dark chocolate (DC) containing 70% cocoa solids and 4% total polyphenol content for three months at a dose of 500 mg/Kg body weight per day to 17-month-old monosodium glutamate treated obese Sprague–Dawley rats, earlier characterized as a nontransgenic AD (NTAD) rat model after reversal of obesity, diabetes, and consequent cognitive impairments. The results demonstrated that DC reduced the hyperglycemia, inhibited the cholinesterase activity in the hippocampal tissue homogenates, and improved the cognitive performance in spatial memory related Barnes maze task. Histological studies revealed an increase in cell volume in the DC treated rats in the CA3 region of the hippocampus.

Such constant daily quota of sleep is maintained through a balance between sleep duration and intensity by sleep homoeostasis. Sleep is important for energy conservation, immune regulation, learning and memory etc. and, hence, important for health and survival.

However, reviews have recommended interpretation of study outcomes in the context of school specific traditional practices. In the literature, practice proficiency is often conflated with hours or years of meditation practice and it is difficult to attribute wellbeing gains directly to the proficiency of practice. We carried out two studies to examine wellbeing, practice proficiency, and duration of practice amongst Brahma Kumaris Rajayoga (BKRY) practitioners from India. In Study 1, we surveyed participants (n = 1009) to record the socio-demographics, spiritual lifestyle components, and wellbeing enhancement attributed to their spiritual practice. We developed new measures for evaluating proficiency of BKRY practice and for assessment of progress in wellbeing attributed to BKRY practice. Both measures had high internal consistency scores (alphas 0.95, 0.93). Block-wise hierarchical linear regression analysis showed that after accounting for demographic variables, BKRY practice proficiency strongly predicted progress in wellbeing, explaining over 51.6% of the total variance. In Study 2, we took three well-matched groups (n = 86) that were distinct on the basis of duration of practice (long term, short term and zero term). We examined wellbeing differences in these three groups and the extent of correlation of wellbeing with practice proficiency, progress in wellbeing and duration of practice. We conclude that meditation practice does improve wellbeing and that proficiency of practice is better correlated with most aspects of wellbeing than duration of practice but there are a few aspects of wellbeing that increase with sustained practice over a long time. We recommend that studies involving other schools of spiritual/religious practice incorporate tradition-specific proficiency assessment (instead of using years of practice as a proxy) and also use the Progress in Wellbeing scale for assessing practiceaided improvements in wellbeing.","2018-12-08","2025-05-08 06:25:41","2025-05-08 06:25:41","2025-05-08 06:25:41","68-88","","2","8","","Intnl.

Yogic practices are claimed to enhance the quality of sleep. Electrophysiological correlates associated with the higher states of consciousness have been reported in long-term practitioners of transcendental meditation during deep sleep states. The present study was carried out to assess sleep architecture in Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) and Vipassana meditators. This was to ascertain the differences, if any, in sleep architecture following yogic practices. Whole night polysomnographic recordings were carried out in 78 healthy male subjects belonging to control and yoga groups. The groups studied were aged between 20 and 30-years-old (younger) and 31 to 55-years-old (middleaged). The sleep architecture was comparable among the younger control and yoga groups. While slow wave sleep (non-REM (rapid eye movement) S3 and S4) had reduced to 3.7 percent in the middleaged control group, participants of the middle-aged yoga groups (both SKY and Vipassana) showed no such decline in slow wave sleep states, which was experienced by 11.76 and 12.76 percent, respectively, of the SKY and Vipassana groups. However, Vipassana practitioners showed a signiﬁcant enhancement (P < 0.001) in their REM sleep state from that of the age-matched control subjects and also from their SKY counterparts. Yoga practices help to retain slow wave sleep and enhance the REM sleep state in the middle age; they appear to retain a younger biological age as far as sleep is concerned.

Given the fundamental role of sleep in health and wellbeing, it is important to study the impact of Covid-19 on sleep quality, dream content and emotionality. This has not been studied among Indian population. The present study was carried out to understand the state of sleep quality, dream contents and the relation between sleep quality and emotionality in people during the Covid-19. Based on previous studies, we expected to find differences among individuals based on how much they were affected by Covid-19, which may be because of pandemic-related stressors (like altered family dynamics, economic stability, etc.). We used Mannheim Dream questionnaire (MADRE), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). We used robust statistics and resampling-based estimates to quantify differences and associations for hypothesis testing. The findings indicate that during pandemic, sleep quality deteriorated with increase in negative affect and improved with increase in positive affect. Sleep quality also deteriorates with an increase in the intensity of emotionally charged dreams. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed a negative relationship between age and negative affect (NA) suggesting that the younger the age, higher the negative affective state. Subjects who reported to be Covid-19 affected had an increased frequency of nightmares and were more distressed by nightmares, compared to those reporting not affected. This supports the notion that sleep, dreams, and affective states were disrupted during the pandemic. Subjects infected with Covid-19 had dreams of relatives or friends suffering from coronavirus and this shows the strong effect of the pandemic on the dream contents. Our study highlights the impact of psychological stress on human sleep, and emotionality. According to the study findings, we suggest that monitoring sleep, dreams, and emotions may help in developing effective interventions to restore sleep quality, prevent sleep disorders, and manage affective behaviour in pandemic like situations.","2023-04-29","2025-05-08 06:25:56","2025-05-08 06:25:57","2025-05-08 06:25:56","40-51 Pages","","","Vol 16","","","COVID-19 pandemic, sleep quality, and emotional tone of dreams","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Datacite)","","Artwork Size: 40-51 Pages Publisher: International Journal of Dream Research","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\F364IC4J\Kumar et al. - 2023 - International Journal of Dream Research - COVID-19 pandemic, sleep quality, and emotional tone of dreams A model to look into how psychologic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dreams reports were collected during the second night by multiple awakening protocol. On the third night, participants were presented with an audiovisual task and during subsequent sleep, dream reports were collected following an auditory stimuli presentation. REM sleep dreams favor high dream recall rates when compared to N2 dreams. Enhanced EEG beta activity, functional connectivity across the brain structures of the default mode network (DMN) and activation of medial frontal cortex were observed during dream recall irrespective of the sleep states. Auditory stimulations influenced emotional dream experiences highlighting the possibility of target memory reactivation.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation has gained immense attention in treating TLE, as ~30% of patients do not respond to anti-epileptic drugs. While MSCs are known to cross the BBB, better CNS homing and therapeutic effects could be achieved when the systemic administration of MSC is timed with BBB damage following SE. Objectives: The objectives of the present study are to investigate the effects of systemic administration of DPSCs/BM-MSCs timed with BBB damage on CNS homing of DPSCs/BM-MSCs, neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation and neuropsychiatric comorbidities in an animal model of TLE. Methodology: We first assessed the BBB leakage following kainic acid-induced SE and timed the intravenous administration of DPSCs/BM-MSCs to understand the CNS homing/engraftment potential of DPSCs/BM-MSCs and their potential to mitigate neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation and neuropsychiatric comorbidities. Results: Our results revealed that systemic administration of DPSCs/BM-MSCs attenuated neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and ameliorated neuropsychiatric comorbidities. Three months following intravenous administration of DPSCs/BM-MSCs, we observed a negligible number of engrafted cells in the corpus callosum, sub-granular zone, and sub-ventricular zone. Conclusion: Thus, it is evident that functional recovery is still achievable despite poor engraftment of MSCs into CNS following systemic administration.
